## Hello, my name is Anderson André!

Software developer with a background in Information Systems and a passion for developing efficient and effective software solutions. My technical skills cover a broad range of areas, including OOP, version control, database management and software design (MVC & MVVM). I am also familiar with various agile methodologies and project management frameworks such as Scrum.

Previously, I worked as a mobile and web developer at a software production company, where I was responsible for developing application screens and functionalities using modern frameworks and libraries. I also have experience in fixing bugs and troubleshooting issues in existing software systems. Apart from my professional experience, I am always working on personal projects to improve my skills and keep up with the latest trends and advancements in the industry.

In addition to my technical skills, I possess a variety of soft skills that are essential for success in software development. I have strong problem-solving abilities and can quickly adapt to changing circumstances. I am also an effective communicator and collaborator, with excellent written and verbal communication skills. I am able to work well in a team environment, and I am always willing to lend a helping hand to my colleagues.

I am eager to take on new challenges and work on projects that allow me to further develop my skills in software development. My goal is to leverage my technical and non-technical skills to contribute to the development of efficient and effective software solutions.

Currently, I'm focused on improving my skills in the Flutter ecosystem to develop cross-platform applications.
